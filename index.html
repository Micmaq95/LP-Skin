                <p style="font-size:small;">To understand good skin care you must realize the goal of good skin is good barrier function.</p>
                <p style="font-size:smaller;">What does that mean? The skin is your body’s fence to the outside world.<br>Learning that the external symptoms we usually focus on trying to correct are at their root a disruption in that barrier is the first step.</p>

                <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p style="font-size:smaller">The skin is made up of cells we can think of as bricks in a wall. As bricks get worn down they have to be replaced. When there’s a problem where we can’t replace the bricks, issues occur.<br>
                For example, when there is a crack in this wall a few things can happen. 
                Bacteria can fill it and the skin can become infected in these cracks turning into whiteheads, pimples, or cysts.
                The skin might overreact with oil(sebum) and/or fill it with too many cells, the combination of which creates a plug or blackhead.
                If the skin dries out, or the bricks get worn down faster than can be replaced (turnover) they result in dull, flakey skin.<br>
                Understanding this, realize that good skin health is a balance of two main functions: Moisture and Cell Turnover. Everybody’s skin is different, monitoring your skin, the environment it’s in and the products that are used in it will help streamline your routine and determine its needs.
