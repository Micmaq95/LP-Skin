                The skin is made up of cells we can think of as bricks in a wall. As bricks get worn down they have to be replaced. When there’s a problem where we can’t replace the bricks, issues occur.<br>
                For example, when there is a crack in this wall a few things can happen. 
                Bacteria can fill it and the skin can become infected in these cracks turning into whiteheads, pimples, or cysts.
                The skin might overreact with oil(sebum) and/or fill it with too many cells, the combination of which creates a plug or blackhead.
                If the skin dries out, or the bricks get worn down faster than can be replaced (turnover) they result in dull, flakey skin.<br><br>
                Understanding this, realize that good skin health is a balance of two main functions: Moisture and Cell Turnover. Everybody’s skin is different, monitoring your skin, the environment it’s in and the products that are used in it will help streamline your routine and determine its needs.

                <h4>Humectants</h4>
                Hydrators; They attract and keep water in your cells. <br><br>
                -Glycerin: Tried and true, the most common humectant in most products. Attracting and holding water molecules around it.<br>
                -Hyaluronic Acid: The most recently popular component works the same way as glycerin.<br>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                <h4>Emollients</h4>
                Fillers; Lipids that fill the cracks in between the cells within the skin.<br><br>
                -Ceramides: Naturally produced by our bodies and make up 50% of the lipids that make up our skin barrier.<br>
                -Squalene: an oil that mimics the structure of our natural sebum, gaining popularity in products.<br>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
               <h4>Occlusives</h4>
                Sealants; Oils/Lipids on the top layer preventing water from evaporating out of our skin.<br><br>
                -Sebum: the bane of oily skin consumers, actually plays a big role in preventing skin from dehydrating.<br>
                -Silicones: popular in many moisturizers, an effective occlusive with a smooth texture.<br>
                </div>

                <h4>Actives</h4>
                Major players that ‘act’ on your skin.<br><br>
                -Exfoliants: Increase cell turnover. i.e. Salicylic Acid/BHA<br>
                -Antioxidants: fight the effects of the environments on your skin. I.e. Vitamin C.<br>
                -Anti-bacterials: Targeted treatments for bacteria i.e. Benzoyl Peroxide.<br>
                -SPF: Blocks oxidative damage caused by solar radiation.<br>

                Arguably the biggest environmental factor is the sun. The sun is responsible for the heat in the environment, causing you to sweat and actively release water from your skin and passively as well if it causes a dry environment. This is where occlusives help. While humectants attract and hold water, it mostly draws water from within your body to hold within the skin. If the environment you’re in is dry and you have no occlusives preventing evaporation, humectants such as hyaluronic acid can’t hold the water and can actually dry out your skin by constantly drawing out water from the inner layers only to be released into the air. Unless the humidity of the air is over 70%, in which case it will draw in moisture from the air into your skin as well. On the flip side, if your skin is well hydrated but cell turnover is low, you may be susceptible to fungal acne.<br>
                Skincare is a multi-factor process. It can also include steps taken outside of products such as maintaining proper water intake, and the use of humidifiers/dehumidifiers indoors. Not to mention diet/lifestyle’s effects on the skin.<br> Hopefully, this insight has changed the way you regard your skin and may help you troubleshoot if you’ve had concerns that you haven’t been able to address.<br>
