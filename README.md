# LP-Skin
TOP-Landing Page Project

The goal of this project is to bring together the lessons on HTML, CSS, The Box Model and Flexbox. It is the second project of the course, the first being a purely HTML page.

I initially skimmed through all the lessons without completing all activities. This was a mistake. I had to return to them in the end and complete the exercises to understand how flexbox worked. I spent 10.5 hrs struggling before returning to the lessons which took 8 hrs total to complete. Afterwards I redid the page basically from scratch in a total of 6 hours. Lesson learned; do not skip exercises!

Note: Although this is drawn from my own knowledge over years of reading published articles and general experience as a beauty consumer I am not a dermatologist or scientist and this should not be taken as professional advice!
